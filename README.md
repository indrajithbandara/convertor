# Convertor

The problem "convertor" was used for the selection of the students who
participated in the ROSEdu [Community and Development Lab](http://cdl.rosedu.org/),
2015 edition.

Special thanks to [Ada](https://github.com/adasolcan) for helping me with
her C++ implementation.

You can send your solutions at the Infoarena judge.
